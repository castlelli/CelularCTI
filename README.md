Work carried out in the first two months at CTI (SÃ£o Paulo State University, Bauru Faculty of Engineering) in 2024. A complete system and user interface was developed to manage stock, orders and products for a fictitious cell phone store.
This project used C# (ASP.NET) for the code and user interface and PgSQL for the database. Object-oriented programming and MVC architecture were used throughout development.
