Work developed in the first two months at the Bauru CTI in 2024.
Using ASP.NET (with NpgSQL extensions) and PgSQL, a complete user interface was developed for managing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete).
The theme selected was that of a cell phone store, with a view to managing customers, orders and available devices.
